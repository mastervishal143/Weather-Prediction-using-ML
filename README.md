# Weather-Prediction-using-ML
Weather Prediction uses some libraries like numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and predict the raining based on the specification of day's temperature, wind speed and pressure.
Initialy we analysed the data which is too large and clean as how much we need and applied the supervised algorithms like Logistic Regression.
Finally we get the result as per the data recommended for that day.
